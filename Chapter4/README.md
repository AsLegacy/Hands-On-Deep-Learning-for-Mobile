# Chapter 4: Optimizing Deep Neural Network Inference

Welcome to the code repo for Chapter 4 of the book. Code here will show you how to make tradeoffs for your DeepLearning network w.r.t mempory and computation v/s inference accuracy. Code will show you how to measure performance, look deeper into network performance metrics, visualize networks and then tune according to your specific needs.
