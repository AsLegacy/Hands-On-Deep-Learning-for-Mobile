# Chapter 1: Basics of Deep Learning

Welcome to the code repo for Chapter 1 of the book. The code requires Jupyter notebook installed, along with TensorFlow. Standard libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib` etc are also required. If you have followed the instructions from the appendix, then you should be all set!

## Data set
For this chapter, we will use the [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) data set. This data set will also be used in Chapter 5 later. `emnist.nyb` will help you download and set the data up.
