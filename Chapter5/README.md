# Chapter 5 : Convolutional Neural Networks

This chapter will continue the EMNIST example along with new examples for smile detection. We will continue work on the EMNIST example to continue to improve accuracy of detection of test. Then, we will solve another key problem in computer vision, which is object or bounding box detection. Using smile detection as an example, we will attempt to build a selfie app that takes a picture as soon as you smile.

## Environment Setup
Use `conda create -n <<name_of_env>> -f conda_env.yml` to create your environment. It is *highly* recommended to use a virtual environment.

Note: Maybe just reuse the Chapter 1 conda env file?

## Key Files
 We will reuse data from `../Chapter1/data` directory for EMNIST. For smile detection, a new data set will be used. TODO: Pls put details here.
