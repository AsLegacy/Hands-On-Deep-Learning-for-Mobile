# Chapter 5: Convolutional Neural Networks

<<tbd add outline of chapter from Packt>>

ToC

## Computer Vision Applications
- get from medium article

## Convolutional Neural Networks
 -- overview of inspiration from visual cortex
 
 ### Filters and Convolutions
  - intuition behind filters like detecting lines or edges
  - show simple example of edge detection filter using a 3x3 applied to a sample EMNIST image
  - generalise to show we can learn different types of such filters
  - highlight that the key here is building better heirarchical features
  - explain convolution math to explain how to compute padding/no padding etc
  
  ### Pooling
  - why pooling? How does it help?
  - how to implement pooling in Keras etc
  
  ### EMNIST with CNNs
  - code up a simple extension to EMNIST code, introduce the utilities lib
  - show how trainable parameters have increased. Ask them to run a parallel exercise on how to 
  
  
  
  
  ## Questions
  1. You may have noticed that the number of trainable parameters have increased significantly when using a CNN.
