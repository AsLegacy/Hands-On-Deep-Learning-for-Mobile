# Chapter 3: Deep Neural Network Inference on Mobile Platforms

Welcome to the code repo for Chapter 3 of the book. Hopfully before coming to this chapter you have good idea on DeepLearning basics and some experince with DeepLearning models. Code here will show you how to deploy pre-trained models specially suited for mobile environment using a spectrum of tools and SDKs.

TBD...
